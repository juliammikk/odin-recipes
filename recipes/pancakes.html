    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy and delicious breakfast you can make with your partner on a slow weekend morning.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g self-raising flour
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder
        </li>
        <li>2 very ripe bananas
        </li>
        <li>2 medium eggs
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>250ml whole milk
        </li>
        <li>butter, for frying
        </li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sieve the flour, baking powder and a generous pinch of salt into a large bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, mash the very ripe bananas with a fork until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract and milk. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the wet ingredients and swiftly whisk together to create a smooth, silky batter.</li>
        <li>Heat a little knob of butter in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the pan and cook for several minutes, or until small bubbles start appearing on the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook for 1-2 mins on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven.</li>
        <li>Stack the pancakes on plates and top with the banana slices and a glug of sticky maple syrup, if you like.</li>
